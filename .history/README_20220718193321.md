## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap v5.0

### Continued development

I'm a junior exploring technologies so I think there are a lot of ways to get the result! I would like to try the challenge with PURE Saas and CSS next time.

PD: Feel free to make suggestions!

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap5-Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - Every single function I need to build this page were in Docs Guide!
